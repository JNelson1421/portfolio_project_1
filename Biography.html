        <h3 id="bio-header">Who am I?</h3>
        <p class="bio-paragraph">I am 23 years old, was born and raised in Scottsdale, Arizona; and I love listening to music and watching sports. My hobbies include DJing, playing video games and performing magic.
            I love attending live sporting events and concerts. On a yearly basis, I go to Colorado to see some of my favorite artists perform at Red Rocks Ampitheatre. 
            I am currently working on my Bachelors degree in Business Administration. I spent some time in Omaha, Nebraska attending Creighton University then decided to move back home. 
            I then attended Scottsdale Community College for a semester before going to the University of Arizona for a year. After the year the was up I decided to switch to online schooling and get a job. 
            I never knew much about coding until I visited a friend of mine in Colorado who codes. One of the days I was there I shadowed him while he was working from home. I became immediately interested in coding and knew it was something I wanted to explore further.</p>
